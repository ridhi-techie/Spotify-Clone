# Spotify-Clone
In this, we’ve developed an interactive, Spotify-inspired music streaming platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The aim was to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience for exploring artists, albums, and playlists — all within a dynamic and modern interface.

HTML was used to build the structural backbone of the platform, ensuring intuitive navigation and organized content. With CSS, we designed a visually appealing layout that’s fully responsive across different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript adds life to the platform, powering real-time playlist updates, responsive user interactions, and smart song recommendations — all handled smoothly on the client side.

By combining these core web technologies, we’ve created an immersive and functional music streaming experience that captures the spirit of Spotify — right in the browser.

Welcome to our creation — where innovation and music come together.
